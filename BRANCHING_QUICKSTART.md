# 🚀 Budget Buddy Mobile - Branching Strategy Quick Start

## 📋 **Current Branch Setup**

✅ **Production Ready!** Your app is now organized with industry-standard branching:

```
🌳 Branch Structure:
├── main     (🚀 Production - Auto-deploys to Render)
├── staging  (🧪 Pre-production testing)  
└── dev      (🛠️ Active development) ← YOU ARE HERE
```

---

## 🎯 **What This Means for You**

### 🚀 **Production (`main`) is Protected**
- Your **live app** stays stable and always working
- Only tested, approved code gets deployed
- **Automatic deployments** to Render when code is merged

### 🧪 **Staging for Final Testing**
- Test features in **production-like environment** 
- Final QA before going live
- Catch integration issues early

### 🛠️ **Development (`dev`) for New Work**
- **Safe space** for new features and experiments
- Integration point for all development work
- Current active branch for daily development

---

## 🔄 **Simple Workflow**

### **For New Features:**
1. **Start here**: You're already on `dev` ✅
2. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`  
3. **Build your feature**: Make commits and push changes
4. **Merge back to dev**: Create PR when ready
5. **Test in staging**: Move to staging for final testing
6. **Deploy to production**: Release to main when approved

### **For Quick Fixes:**
- **Direct to dev**: Small changes can go directly to `dev`
- **Emergency fixes**: Use hotfix branches for critical production issues

### **For Releases:**
- **dev → staging**: When features are ready for testing
- **staging → main**: When testing passes and ready for production

---

## 🛠️ **Quick Commands**

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout dev
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Switch between branches  
git checkout dev      # Development work
git checkout staging  # Testing environment
git checkout main     # Production code

# Push your work
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Use our helper script
python scripts/git-workflow.py
```

## 🎨 **Interactive Workflow Helper**

We've created a **Python script** to make Git operations easier:

```bash
python scripts/git-workflow.py
```

**Features:**
- 🔧 Create feature branches automatically
- 📝 Semantic commit helpers  
- 🌳 Branch status overview
- 🚨 Hotfix branch creation
- 📋 Workflow guidance

---

## 🏷️ **Semantic Commits**

Use **consistent commit messages** for better tracking:

```
feat(auth): add user tier synchronization
fix(ledger): resolve balance display issue  
docs(readme): update installation instructions
security(api): patch authentication vulnerability
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `security`, `perf`

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

### **Current Environment Setup:**
- **Production**: `main` branch → Render auto-deployment ✅
- **Staging**: `staging` branch → Ready for testing environment  
- **Development**: `dev` branch → Your active workspace ✅

### **What's Deployed:**
- ✅ **Tier synchronization fix** - Elite tier recognition works immediately
- ✅ **Security improvements** - SQL prompt injection protection  
- ✅ **Clean codebase** - Organized files and structure
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** - All systems verified

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Keep developing on `dev`** - You're all set! 
2. **Create feature branches** for larger features
3. **Use semantic commits** for better tracking
4. **Test in staging** before production releases
5. **Deploy to main** when ready for users

Your **production app is stable** and **development is organized**! 🎉

## 🆘 **Need Help?**

### **Branch Issues:**
```bash
# See current status
git status
git branch -a

# Switch branches safely  
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# Reset if needed
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### **Quick Status Check:**
```bash
python scripts/git-workflow.py  # Interactive helper
git log --oneline -5            # Recent commits
git branch --show-current       # Current branch
```

**Your app is production-ready with proper development workflow!** 🚀
