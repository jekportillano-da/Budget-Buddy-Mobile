# AI Service Configuration Issues - URGENT FIX NEEDED

## Problem Identified
The AI services (both frontend Cohere and backend AI endpoints) are **NOT WORKING** because the Cohere API key is not properly configured in the deployment environment.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Frontend**: Cohere API key exists in `.env.local` but service wasn't reading it properly (FIXED)
- ‚ùå **Backend**: Cohere API key is NOT configured on Render.com environment variables
- ‚ùå **Result**: AI insights return fallback/generic responses instead of real Cohere AI responses

## Required Immediate Action

### 1. Configure Render Environment Variables
You need to add the following environment variable to your Render.com service:

**Go to**: https://dashboard.render.com ‚Üí Budget Buddy Service ‚Üí Environment Variables

**Add**:
```
Name: COHERE_API_KEY
Value: q6PNPoeEUS1QeYFrWgNLUOL40qI13ay7si4fSINS
```

### 2. Frontend Fix Applied
I've already fixed the frontend Cohere service to read from both:
- `process.env.COHERE_API_KEY` (primary)
- `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_COHERE_API_KEY` (fallback)

## What Was Happening

### Frontend Issue (FIXED)
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
this.apiKey = process.env.COHERE_API_KEY || 'PLEASE_SET_YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY';

// AFTER (fixed):
this.apiKey = 
  process.env.COHERE_API_KEY || 
  process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_COHERE_API_KEY ||
  'PLEASE_SET_YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY';
```

### Backend Issue (NEEDS FIX)
The backend expects `COHERE_API_KEY` environment variable but it's not set on Render:

```python
# Backend looking for:
COHERE_API_KEY = config("COHERE_API_KEY", default="")

# Result: Empty string, so AI falls back to generic responses
```

## Verification Steps

### After Setting the Environment Variable:
1. **Restart Render Service** (automatic after env var change)
2. **Test Backend Configuration**:
   ```bash
   curl https://budget-buddy-mobile.onrender.com/ai/debug/config
   ```
   Should return: `"cohere_configured": true`

3. **Test AI Chat**:
   ```bash
   # Get auth token first
   curl -X POST https://budget-buddy-mobile.onrender.com/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"jejekportillano@gmail.com","password":"newpassword123"}'
   
   # Use token to test AI chat
   curl -X POST https://budget-buddy-mobile.onrender.com/ai/chat \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message":"How can I save money on groceries in the Philippines?"}'
   ```

4. **Test Mobile App AI Features**:
   - AI Insights should show personalized Filipino financial advice
   - AI Chatbot should respond with contextual advice instead of generic responses

## Expected Results After Fix

### AI Insights (Before vs After)
**BEFORE (Generic)**:
```
"Consider setting up an emergency fund"
"Track your expenses regularly"
"Look for ways to reduce monthly bills"
```

**AFTER (Cohere AI)**:
```
"üèôÔ∏è NCR INSIGHT: Your bills compare to Metro Manila averages. Consider Kadiwa stores for groceries (30% savings)"
"‚òÄÔ∏è SUMMER ALERT: Expect 30-40% higher electricity bills during peak summer (March-May). Budget extra ‚Ç±1,500-2,500 monthly"
"üí° Based on your ‚Ç±25,000 monthly income and ‚Ç±18,000 expenses, you're doing well but could optimize utilities"
```

### AI Chatbot (Before vs After)
**BEFORE (Generic)**:
```
User: "How to save on groceries?"
Bot: "You can save on groceries by making a shopping list and comparing prices."
```

**AFTER (Cohere AI)**:
```
User: "How to save on groceries?"
Bot: "In the Philippines, try these strategies: 1) Shop at Kadiwa stores for 30% savings on fresh produce, 2) Buy rice in bulk during harvest season (Oct-Dec), 3) Use GrabMart/FoodPanda for price comparison, 4) Visit wet markets early morning for better prices. Based on your Metro Manila location, avoid peak hour shopping at SM/Robinson's for better deals."
```

## Critical Impact
- **User Experience**: Generic responses feel like broken AI
- **App Value**: AI features are the core differentiator
- **User Trust**: Users notice when AI responses are repetitive/generic

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Add `COHERE_API_KEY` to Render environment variables
2. **Verify**: Use debug endpoint to confirm configuration
3. **Test**: Try AI features in mobile app
4. **Monitor**: Check logs for real Cohere API usage

## Files Modified
- `services/cohereAIService.ts` - Fixed environment variable reading
- `backend/ai/routes.py` - Added debug configuration endpoint

## Security Note
The API key is already exposed in the repository's .env.local file, so adding it to Render is not a new security risk. In production, you should:
1. Use a separate production API key
2. Remove the key from .env.local
3. Use proper secrets management
