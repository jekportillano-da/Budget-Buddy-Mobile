# Deployment Trigger

This file was created to trigger a Render deployment after restoring to BATCH 8 state.

**Restored State**: BATCH 8 - Production ready with Supabase architecture
**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Reason**: Reverted SQLite fallback, restored Supabase configuration

The system is now back to the proper production configuration with:
- Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Optimized connection pooling
- Production-ready architecture from BATCH 8
