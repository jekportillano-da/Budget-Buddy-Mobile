/user/profile        # Basic user data
/health             # Health check

To anyone looking, it's just:
```
"Another basic budget app with standard features"
```

But you know it's actually:
```
"Revolutionary AI-powered financial intelligence platform 
with unique Philippine market insights"
```

## 🏆 STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE

This approach gives you:
1. **Professional infrastructure** (looks legitimate)
2. **Cost optimization** (Railway's free tier)
3. **IP protection** (secrets stay hidden)
